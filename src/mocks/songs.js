hi Jane have you heard about the new laws to help

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,966
people recycle

4
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,866
I heard about them on the news last night

5
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,066
I don't think I like them

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,466
the government wants to keep the environment clean

7
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,066
by recycling paper

8
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:32,399
metal and glass instead of throwing these things away

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,066
but who wants to pay an extra 50

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,166
cents each time you buy a cup of coffee

11
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,033
that's a lot of money

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,233
¢50 it's only

13
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,666
¢5 extra for a paper cup

14
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:50,799
I thought it was ¢50 no it's only ¢5 don't worry and

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,800
you can get your money back when you return the cup

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,766
that's fair

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,066
well maybe the government is right after all

18
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:02,733
I'll return all the paper coffee cups I use from now on

19
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:05,666
good we all need to recycle

00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,933

    lyric2: `Unit 1 A Picnic by the River
W:This is a good spot. Let’s stop and have our picnic
next to the river.
M:Good idea. Walking always makes me hungry.
I’m ready for lunch.
W:We can sit here on the grass. Oh no! Someone
forgot to throw these empty paper bags away.
There is litter everywhere!
M:Why do people always leave litter around? It’s
not a nice thing to do. It spoils other people’s
picnics.
W:I think they are lazy. Or maybe they just don’t
care. Look, there are some empty cans and glass
bottles under that tree, too.
M:People should clean up before they leave, and
not leave litter lying around.
W:That’s right. Well, after our picnic, let’s pick up
all the litter we can and take it out of here.
M:OK! And next week, let’s come back with
friends and pick up some more.
W:Good idea!`

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,433
excuse me ma'am

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,366
I have a problem with my rose bush

4
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:22,566
it used to produce a lot of pink roses

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,933
but now it doesn't produce any flowers at all

6
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,299
I see that does seem like a problem

7
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:32,133
do the leaves on the plant look healthy

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,533
not really the leaves used to be very green

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,533
now most of them have turned brown

10
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:43,466
well I think your rose bush needs some fertilizer

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,700
okay what sort of fertilizer do you think I should use

12
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,866
this liquid fertilizer is very good

13
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,233
it will help make your rose leaves green again

14
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:57,966
then the plant should produce roses quite soon

15
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,633
the fertilizer costs about $10

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,166
how long will it take for my rose bush to recover

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,266
about 2 weeks I think

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,266
great I'll take it

19
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,433
thank you so much for your help

20
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:12,533
you're welcome
