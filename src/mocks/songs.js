W: This is a good spot. Let’s stop and have our picnic
next to the river.
M: Good idea. Walking always makes me hungry.
I’m ready for lunch.
W: We can sit here on the grass. Oh no! Someone
forgot to throw these empty paper bags away.
There is litter everywhere!
M: Why do people always leave litter around? It’s
not a nice thing to do. It spoils other people’s
picnics.
W: I think they are lazy. Or maybe they just don’t
care. Look, there are some empty cans and glass
bottles under that tree, too. 
M: People should clean up before they leave, and
not leave litter lying around. 
W: That’s right. Well, after our picnic, let’s pick up
all the litter we can and take it out of here.
M: OK! And next week, let’s come back with
friends and pick up some more.

don’t think I like them.

clean by recycling paper, metal, and glass
instead of throwing these things away.

time you buy a cup of coffee? That’s a lot of
money!

cup.

M: No, it’s only five cents. Don’t worry. And you
can get your money back when you return the
cup.

from now on.

leaves on the plant look healthy?

Now, most of them have turned brown.
W: Well, I think your rose bush needs some fertilizer.
M: OK. What sort of fertilizer do you think I should
use? 
W: This liquid fertilizer is very good. It will help
make your rose leaves green again. Then the
plant should produce roses quite soon. The
fertilizer costs about ten dollars.
M: How long will it take for my rose bush to recover?

help.

Fir, cedar, and pine are three. These trees grow in
different areas. Some grow in forests. Some grow
on the mountains. People who lived in this place
long ago used these trees to make things out of
wood.
Many of these trees are now in special areas.
These areas are called forest reserves or national
parks. 
Some parks charge a small entrance fee.
Visitors must pay the fee to enter the parks.
Then they can walk among the beautiful old
trees. They must take care not to damage the
trees. We should all take care of forests.`

G : Where do the bubbles come from when you
boil water? 
Water is a liquid. When it is heated, it moves
around faster and faster. When it starts to boil,
the liquid turns into a gas. This gas is called
water vapor. This gas is lighter than the water
around it. It rises to the top. Then it disappears
into the air.
As the water gets hotter and hotter, it starts
turning into gas very quickly. A lot of bubbles
form at the same time. All these bubbles try to
escape at once. The bubbles push the water out
of the way and “jump” out. This is what we call
“boiling water.”
More and more water turns into gas. More
of it disappears into the air. After a while, every
drop of the water will be gone. Try it and see!`

B : Joe asked me something about science just now.

G : I’m good at science. Ask me.
B : OK. Why is the sky blue? 
G : I’ll explain it in a simple way. Light comes
through the air from the sun in waves. 
B : The light is in many colors, right?
G : Right. Blue light waves are smaller than air
molecules. They sometimes get absorbed by
these molecules. 
B : OK. What happens then?
G : Then the blue light waves scatter in many
directions. Your eyes see this blue light from
above you, after it leaves the air molecules.
B : So that is what makes the sky blue! What
happens to the other colors?
G : They reflect off the things that they hit. Your
shirt is red because our eyes see the red light
reflected from it.

M: Gold has been a part of many cultures for
hundreds of years. People made coins and jewelry
with gold. 
Gold is a soft metal. It is easy to shape into
sheets, long wires, or rings. People sometimes
mix gold with other metals. This makes the gold
harder. Then it can be made into beautiful jewelry.
Why do we value gold so much? It has a
special color. No other metal is a bright yellow.
We also value gold because it is rare. A rare
thing is hard to find. Even after hundreds of
years, gold is still a precious metal now. It is still
valued for its beauty. It is still rare.
Today, banks store gold in the form of bars.
Its value is more than $600 per ounce. Gold is
more useful now than ever before.`

music can understand these notes. This is how
people can sing the song or play it.
Lots of people like to play music. Music can
