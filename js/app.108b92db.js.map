Have you heard about the new laws to help people recycle?\nW:   I heard about them on the news last night. I don’t think I like them.\nM:   The government wants to keep the environment clean by recycling paper, metal, and glass instead of throwing these things away.\nW:   But who wants to pay an extra 50 cents each time you buy a cup of coffee? That’s a lot of money!\nM:   50 cents? It’s only five cents extra for a paper cup.\nW:   I thought it was 50 cents!\nM:   No, it’s only five cents. Don’t worry. And you can get your money back when you return the cup.\nW:   That’s fair. Well, maybe the government is right, after all. I’ll return all the paper coffee cups I use from now on.\nM:   Good! We all need to recycle. It helps to keep the environment clean.`\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    title: \"Unit 3 Growing Roses\",\n    artist: \"LPTD\",\n    seconds: 64,\n    cover: require(\"../assets/images/cover.jpg\"),\n    src: require(\"../assets/audios/LPTD1.1/Unit 3 Growing Roses.mp3\"),\n    lyric1: `1\n00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,733\nunit 3 growing roses\n\n2\n00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,466\nexcuse me ma'am\n\n3\n00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,399\nI have a problem with my rose bush\n\n4\n00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,600\nit used to produce a lot of pink roses\n\n5\n00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,966\nbut now it doesn't produce any flowers at all\n\n6\n00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:18,333\nI see that does seem like a problem\n\n7\n00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,166\ndo the leaves on the plant look healthy\n\n8\n00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,566\nnot really the leaves used to be very green\n\n9\n00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,566\nnow most of them have turned brown\n\n10\n00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:32,499\nwell I think your rose bush needs some fertilizer\n\n11\n00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,733\nokay what sort of fertilizer do you think I should use\n\n12\n00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:39,899\nthis liquid fertilizer is very good\n\n13\n00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,266\nit will help make your rose leaves green again\n\n14\n00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,000\nthen the plant should produce roses quite soon\n\n15\n00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,666\nthe fertilizer costs about $10\n\n16\n00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,199\nhow long will it take for my rose bush to recover\n\n17\n00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,299\nabout 2 weeks I think\n\n18\n00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,299\ngreat I'll take it\n\n19\n00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,466\nthank you so much for your help\n\n20\n00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,566\nyou're welcome\n`,\n    lyric2: `Growing Roses\nM:   Excuse me, ma’am.
